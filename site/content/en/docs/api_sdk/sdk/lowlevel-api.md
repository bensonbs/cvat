## Overview

The low-level API is useful if you need to work directly with REST API, but want
to have data validation and syntax assistance from your code editor. The code
on this layer is autogenerated.

Code of this component is located in `cvat_sdk.api_client`.

## Example

Let's see how a task with local files can be created. We will use the basic auth
to make things simpler.

```python
from time import sleep
from cvat_sdk.api_client import Configuration, ApiClient, models, apis, exceptions

configuration = Configuration(
    host="http://localhost",
    username='YOUR_USERNAME',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Parameters can be passed as a plain dict with JSON-serialized data
    # or as model objects (from cvat_sdk.api_client.models), including
    # mixed variants.
    #
    # In case of dicts, keys must be the same as members of models.I<ModelName>
    # interfaces and values must be convertible to the corresponding member
    # value types (e.g. a date or string enum value can be parsed from a string).
    #
    # In case of model objects, data must be of the corresponding
    # models.<ModelName> types.
    #
    # Let's use a dict here. It should look like models.ITaskWriteRequest
    task_spec = {
        'name': 'example task',
        "labels": [{
            "name": "car",
            "color": "#ff00ff",
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "a",
                    "mutable": True,
                    "input_type": "number",
                    "default_value": "5",
                    "values": ["4", "5", "6"]
                }
            ]
        }],
    }

    try:
        # Apis can be accessed as ApiClient class members
        # We use different models for input and output data. For input data,
        # models are typically called like "*Request". Output data models have
        # no suffix.
        (task, response) = api_client.tasks_api.create(task_spec)
    except exceptions.ApiException as e:
        # We can catch the basic exception type, or a derived type
        print("Exception when trying to create a task: %s\n" % e)

    # Here we will use models instead of a dict
    task_data = models.DataRequest(
        image_quality=75,
        client_files=[
            open('image1.jpg', 'rb'),
            open('image2.jpg', 'rb'),
        ],
    )

    # If we pass binary file objects, we need to specify content type.
    # For this endpoint, we don't have response data
    (_, response) = api_client.tasks_api.create_data(task.id,
        data_request=task_data,
        _content_type="multipart/form-data",

        # we can choose to check the response status manually
        # and disable the response data parsing
        _check_status=False, _parse_response=False
    )
    assert response.status == 202, response.msg

    # Wait till task data is processed
    for _ in range(100):
        (status, _) = api_client.tasks_api.retrieve_status(task.id)
        if status.state.value in ['Finished', 'Failed']:
            break
        sleep(0.1)
    assert status.state.value == 'Finished', status.message

    # Update the task object and check the task size
    (task, _) = api_client.tasks_api.retrieve(task.id)
    assert task.size == 4
```

## ApiClient and configuration

The starting point in the low-level API is the `cvat_sdk.api_client.ApiClient` class.
It encapsulates session and connection logic, manages headers and cookies,
and provides access to various APIs.

To create an instance of `ApiClient`, you need to set up a `cvat_sdk.api_client.Configuration`
object and pass it to the `ApiClient` class constructor. Additional connection-specific
options, such as extra headers and cookies can be specified in the class constructor.
`ApiClient` implements the context manager protocol. Typically, you create `ApiClient` this way:

```python
from cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, Configuration

configuration = Configuration(host="http://localhost")
with ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    ...
```

After creating an `ApiClient` instance, you can send requests to various server endpoints
via `*_api` member properties and directly, using the `rest_client` member.
[Read more](#api-wrappers) about API wrappers below.

Typically, the first thing you do with `ApiClient` is log in.
[Read more](#authentication) about authentication options below.

## Authentication

CVAT supports 2 authentication options:
- basic auth, with your username and password
- token auth, with your API key

Token auth requires a token, which can be obtained after performing the basic auth.

The low-level API supports 2 ways of authentication.
You can specify authentication parameters in the `Configuration` object:

```python
configuration = Configuration(
    username='YOUR_USERNAME',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
)
```

```python
configuration = Configuration(
    api_key={
        "sessionAuth": "<sessionid cookie value>",
        "csrfAuth": "<csrftoken cookie value>",
        "tokenAuth": "Token <auth key value>",
    }
)
```

You can perform a regular login using the `auth_api` member of `ApiClient` and
set the `Authorization` header using the `Token` prefix. This way, you'll be able to
obtain API tokens, which can be reused in the future to avoid typing your credentials.

```python
from cvat_sdk.api_client import models

(auth, _) = api_client.auth_api.create_login(
    models.LoginRequest(username=credentials[0], password=credentials[1])
)

assert "sessionid" in api_client.cookies
assert "csrftoken" in api_client.cookies
api_client.set_default_header("Authorization", "Token " + auth.key)
```

## API wrappers

API endpoints are grouped by tags into separate classes in the `cvat_sdk.api_client.apis` package.

APIs can be accessed as `ApiClient` object members:

```python
api_client.auth_api.<operation>(...)
api_client.tasks_api.<operation>(...)
```

And APIs can be instantiated directly like this:

```python
from cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, apis

api_client = ApiClient(...)

auth_api = apis.AuthApi(api_client)
auth_api.<operation>(...)

tasks_api = apis.TasksApi(api_client)
tasks_api.<operation>(...)
```

For each operation, the API wrapper class has a corresponding `<operation>_endpoint` member.
This member represents the endpoint as a first-class object, which provides metainformation
about the endpoint, such as the relative URL of the endpoint, parameter names,
types and their placement in the request. It also allows to pass the operation to other
functions and invoke it from there.

For a typical server entity like `Task`, `Project`, `Job` etc., the `*Api` classes provide methods
that reflect Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations: `create`, `retrieve`, `list`, `update`,
`partial_update`, `delete`. The set of available operations depends on the entity type.

You can find the list of the available APIs and their documentation [here](../reference/apis/).

## Models

Requests and responses can include data. It can be represented as plain Python
data structures and model classes (or models). In CVAT API, model for requests and responses
are separated: the request models have the `Request` suffix in the name, while the response
models have no suffix. Models can be found in the `cvat_sdk.api_client.models` package.

Models can be instantiated like this:

```python
from cvat_sdk.api_client import models

user_model = models.User(...)
```

Model parameters can be passed as models, or as plain Python data structures. This rule applies
recursively, starting from the method parameters. In particular, this means you can pass
a dict into a method or into a model constructor, and corresponding fields will
be parsed from this data automatically:

```python
task_spec = models.TaskWriteRequest(
    name='example task',
    labels=[
        models.PatchedLabelRequest(
            name="car",
            color="#ff00ff",
            attributes=[
                model.AttributeRequest(
                    name="a",
                    mutable=True,
                    input_type="number",
                    default_value="5",
                    values=["4", "5", "6"]
                )
            ]
        )
    ],
)
api_client.tasks_api.create(task_spec)
```

Is equivalent to:

```python
api_client.tasks_api.create({
    'name': 'example task',
    "labels": [{
        "name": "car",
        "color": "#ff00ff",
        "attributes": [
            {
                "name": "a",
                "mutable": True,
                "input_type": "number",
                "default_value": "5",
                "values": ["4", "5", "6"]
            }
        ]
    }],
})
```

You can mix these variants.

Most models provide corresponding interface classes called like `I<model name>`. They can be
used to implement your own classes or describe APIs. They just provide type annotations
and descriptions for model fields.

You can export model values to plain Python dicts using the `as_dict()` method and
the `cvat_sdk.api_client.model_utils.to_json()` function.

You can find the list of the available models and their documentation [here](../reference/models/).

## Sending requests

To send a request to a server endpoint, you need to obtain an instance of the corresponding `*Api`
class. You can find summary about available API classes and supported endpoints
[here](../reference/apis). The `*Api` instance object allows to send requests to the relevant
server endpoints.

By default, all operations return 2 objects: the parsed response data and the response itself.
A typical call looks like this:

```python
from cvat_sdk.api_client import ApiClient, apis

with ApiClient(...) as api_client:
    ...
    (data, response) = api_client.tasks_api.list()
    # process the response ...
```

Operation parameters can be passed as positional or keyword arguments. There are also several
extra arguments which change invocation logic:

- `_parse_response` - Allows to enable and disable response data parsing. When enabled,
  the response data is parsed into a model or a basic type and returned as the first value.
  When disabled, the response is not parsed, and `None` is returned. Can be useful,
  for instance, if you need to parse data manually, or if you expect an error in the response.
- `_check_status` - Allows to enable or disable response status checks. When enabled, the
  response status code is checked to be positive as defined in the [HTTP standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).
  In case of negative status, an exception is raised.
- `_request_timeout` - Allows to control timeout
- `_content_type` - Allows to specify the `Content-Type` header value for the request. Endpoints
  can support different content types and behave differently depending on the value. For file
  uploads `_content_type="multipart/form-data"` must be specified.

> **NOTE**: the API is autogenerated. In some cases the server API schema may be incomplete
or underspecified. Please report to us all the problems found. A typical problem is that a
response data can't be parsed automatically due to the incorrect schema. In this case, the
simplest workaround is to disable response parsing using the `_parse_response=False`
method argument.

You can find many examples of API client usage in REST API tests [here](https://github.com/opencv/cvat/tree/develop/tests/python).

### Organizations

To call an operation in the context of an organization, use one of these method arguments:

- `org` - The unique organization slug
- `org_id`- The organization id

```python
...
(updated_annotations, response) = api_client.tasks_api.partial_update_annotations(
    id=task_id,
    org_id=org_id,
    action='update',
    patched_labeled_data_request=data
)
```

### Paginated responses

There are several endpoints that allow to request multiple server entities. Typically, these
endpoints are called `list_...`. When there are lots of data, the responses can be paginated to
reduce server load. If an endpoint returns paginated data, a single page is returned per request.
In some cases all entries need to be retrieved. CVAT doesn't provide specific API or parameters
for this, so the solution is to write a loop to collect and join data from multiple requests.
SDK provides an utility function for this at `cvat_sdk.core.helpers.get_paginated_collection()`.

Example:

```python
from cvat_sdk.core.helpers import get_paginated_collection

...
project_tasks = get_paginated_collection(
    api_client.projects_api.list_tasks_endpoint,
    id=project_id,
)
```
